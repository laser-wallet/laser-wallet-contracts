# Laser Wallet Contracts

## Laser Wallet is a non-custodial smart contract wallet made for the EVM.

### It implements the following features:

### 1. Smart Social Recovery: A new recovery mechanism that abstracts away the seed phrase while remaining non-custodial. 

### 2. It is primarily made so the transactions are sent through a relayer, so it abstracts away the need to pay gas through an EOA.

## Acknowledgements

## Building in the Open 

### Laser is commited to build in the open. Apart from the code being open sourced, all the everyday commits will be on public repos.

## Open-source software

#### We are strong believers of open-source software. 100% of Laser's code is open sourced.
