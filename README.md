# Laser Wallet Contracts

## Laser Wallet is a non-custodial smart contract based mobile wallet for Ethereum mainnet and rollups. 

### It implements the following features:

### 1. Sovereign Social Recovery: A new recovery mechanism that abstracts away the seed phrase while remaining non-custodial. 

### 2. EIP-4337: Account abstraction, allows for the smart contract wallet to behave like a regular EOA, while providing all the benefits of a smart contract. 

### 3. Extra security features: It allows the user to use multi-sig or spending limit.
